## 1. How would you implement 301 redirects in Nuxt that are manageable?Depending on the use case, 301s could be managed in a few different layers of the stack.### Option 1: `routeRules` in `nuxt.config.ts` (best for static, predictable redirects)The simplest and fastest SEO-friendly option is to define 301 redirects in Nuxt 4 via the `routeRules` property inside `nuxt.config.ts`. These rules are evaluated at the edge or server before the application code runs, ensuring minimal latency and correct HTTP status codes for search engines. This approach is ideal for permanent and predictable redirects that rarely change (e.g., legacy URLs, rebranded pages).```ts// nuxt.config.tsexport default defineNuxtConfig({  routeRules: {    '/old-blog': { redirect: { to: '/new-blog', statusCode: 301 } },    '/outdated-page': { redirect: { to: '/modern-page', statusCode: 301 } },  },})```Good for static or rarely changing mappings but requires a redeploy to update. Fastest and lowest maintenance for simple cases.---### Option 2: Middleware-based redirects (dynamic, per-request logic)When a redirect depends on runtime logic (such as user locale, query parameters, or authentication state) the redirect can be handled in Nuxt route middleware. Middleware runs on both server and client, but for SEO and proper 301 handling, the best option is server-side middleware.```ts// middleware/redirect-legacy.tsexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {  if (to.path === '/legacy') {    return navigateTo('/replacement', { redirectCode: 301 })  }  // Example: redirect based on query or user agent  if (to.query['utm_source'] === 'old-campaign') {    return navigateTo('/campaign-landing', { redirectCode: 301 })  }})```This middleware could be registered globally or per-route as needed.Good for when redirects must be determined dynamically per request. Slightly higher overhead than static rules, but needed for logic-based or data-driven redirects.---### Option 3: Server middleware or API-driven redirects (scalable, CMS-integrated)For large-scale projects, or when redirect rules are managed outside of code (e.g., by content editors in a CMS or external database), the best option is to implement redirects via Nuxt server middleware. This allows us to fetch or compute redirect rules at runtime, enabling thousands of redirects or frequent updates without redeploying.```ts// server/middleware/redirects.tsimport { readRedirectsFromCMS } from '~/server/utils/redirects'export default defineEventHandler(async event => {  const redirects = await readRedirectsFromCMS()  const reqPath = event.req.url  const rule = redirects.find(r => r.from === reqPath)  if (rule) {    event.res.statusCode = 301    event.res.setHeader('Location', rule.to)    event.res.end()  }})```Here, `readRedirectsFromCMS()` could fetch from a database, headless CMS, or an API.Good for when redirect rules are managed externally, are very numerous, or need to be updated in real time. More complex to implement and test, but needed for high-scale or editorially managed sites.---#### Operational considerations- **Performance:** routeRules are fastest; middleware and dynamic options add flexibility.- **Maintainability:** Static config for simple, stable cases. For frequent changes or non-developer management, it is better to use API- or CMS-driven redirects.---## 2. How would you monitor the application for errors?Monitoring a production Nuxt application should cover client-side and server-side behavior, along with performance and uptime.  Here’s how I’d structure it in a real-world setup:### 1. Client-side monitoring (user-facing errors)I’d use a service like **Sentry**, **PostHog**, or **LogRocket** to automatically capture errors that occur in the browser. These tools log stack traces, browser context, and even replay sessions so we can see what users experienced right before something broke.This captures: runtime JS errors, network failures, and slow front-end interactions.### 2. Server-side monitoring (SSR and APIs)For the backend part (Nuxt server routes, SSR rendering, or APIs), I’d also hook Sentry or Bugsnag into the server runtime.  If the app runs on **Vercel** (as the one I developed for this assignment), I’d combine that with **Vercel Logs** and a structured logger like `pino` or `consola` for detailed request traces.This captures: SSR rendering errors, failed API calls, and crashes before they reach users.---### 3. In-app handling (graceful UX)Monitoring is only half of it! I’d make sure the app **recovers gracefully** when something fails.- Use `createError()` and `showError()` in server routes to standardize error responses.- Wrap sensitive UI sections in `<NuxtErrorBoundary>` so one bad component doesn’t crash the entire page.- For client logic, I’d rely on Nuxt’s `useError()` composable to show fallback messages instead of blank screens.This keeps the app usable even when something goes wrong.---### 4. Performance and uptime monitoringIf we integrate **PostHog** or **Google Analytics 4**, I’d track slow-loading pages or spikes in failed requests to detect regressions before users report them.---### 5. Alerting and workflow integrationErrors mean nothing if no one sees them.  I’d connect Sentry or Datadog alerts to **Slack**, with thresholds based on volume and severity.  For example:- A single 404 → low priority- 10+ 500s in 1 minute → Slack notificationThis keeps the response quick and organized without overwhelming the team.---### 6. Development and testing visibilityIn local and staging environments:- Keep `debug: true` in `nuxt.config.ts` to surface stack traces.- Watch server logs directly (`pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`) for fast iteration.- Use console warnings or mocked Sentry DSNs to verify integrations before production.---### 7. Unit and integration testing (proactive monitoring)While tools like Sentry or Datadog help you react to issues in production, a solid **testing strategy** helps prevent most of those issues from ever reaching users.In a Nuxt app, I’d use **Vitest** (or Jest) together with **Vue Test Utils** to write unit and integration tests that validate both UI components and business logic.  For example:- Unit tests for composables (e.g., form validation, data fetching).- Snapshot tests for components to catch unexpected template changes.- Integration tests for core user flows (e.g., submitting a form, navigating between pages).---## 3. If you could pick one CMS for the website bywinona.com, what would it be and why? What would be good and what would be bad with the choice of the CMS?I’d choose **Contentful** as the CMS for bywinona.com.  It’s a modern headless CMS that integrates very well with **Nuxt** and provides both **editor flexibility** for marketing teams and **API consistency** for developers.The main reason is that Winona’s marketing site needs to publish new content frequently (articles, testimonials, campaign pages, etc.) without requiring developer involvement every time. Contentful’s structured content model and webhook integrations make that process smooth, while still allowing for scalability and CI/CD automation.It also fits nicely with Winona’s needs, having a decoupled CMS that exposes data through APIs allows for **future integrations**, like syncing blog data, SEO metadata, or banners across the **main website** and the **patient portal**.---### Good things about using Contentful- **Headless flexibility:** Data is delivered through APIs, so it’s easy to reuse the same content across multiple apps (the website, patient portal, or mobile app).- **Editor-friendly:** The UI is intuitive for non-technical users — editors can create, schedule, and update content without touching the codebase.- **Webhooks for CI/CD:** Automatically trigger rebuilds or cache invalidations on Cloud platforms when new content is published, keeping the site fresh without manual deployment.- **Localization & scalability:** Contentful natively supports multiple locales, which is valuable as the company expands or personalizes regional content.- **Preview environments:** Editors can preview unpublished content live on the site before it goes live, improving workflow and confidence.---### Drawbacks or trade-offs- **Pricing:** It can get expensive at scale (especially with multiple environments and large API usage).- **API dependency:** If Contentful’s API is slow or temporarily down, it affects the content fetching pipeline. This can be mitigated with caching.- **Schema rigidity:** Once content models are defined, large structural changes require developer involvement. Non-technical users may find model changes difficult.- **Limited custom logic:** It doesn’t handle heavy custom backend logic (which is fine, since that belongs in Winona’s main backend).---### High-level requirements#### From a technical perspective1. **Headless CMS architecture** — Content layer accessible via GraphQL or REST APIs.2. **Fast integration with Nuxt** — use Contentful’s official SDK or Nuxt Contentful module for SSR and caching.3. **CI/CD integration** — trigger automatic Cloud deployments via Contentful webhooks.4. **Caching strategy** — implement edge caching or ISR to balance freshness with performance.5. **Content versioning & rollback** — ensure editors can revert changes safely.6. **Preview & staging environments** — separate preview URLs for draft content review.7. **Security** — read-only API tokens for the frontend, environment-level access control.8. **SEO support** — structured fields for meta titles, descriptions, slugs, and OpenGraph data.#### From a user/editor perspective1. **Easy-to-use interface** for marketing and content teams.2. **Rich text & media management** for blog posts and landing pages.3. **Content scheduling & publishing workflow** with roles and approvals.4. **Localization support** for different markets or campaigns.5. **Preview mode** to visualize changes before publishing.6. **Reusable content blocks** (e.g., testimonials, banners).7. **Real-time updates without developer help** — publish and see live results immediately.---Contentful provides the right balance between developer control and marketing flexibility.  It integrates cleanly with Nuxt, scales with future needs, and supports automation and preview workflows, all of which are key for a brand like Winona that needs a fast-moving, reliable, and content-driven site.---## 4. If you had to technically improve the homepage of bywinona.com. What would you improve? In which order?After reviewing the bywinona.com homepage and running a quick Lighthouse audit, I found that the site is already well-designed, visually engaging, and content-rich. That said, there are still a few technical areas where we could elevate performance, accessibility, SEO, and long-term scalability.Here’s how I’d approach those improvements and in what order.---### Performance optimization (first priority)When I ran a Lighthouse audit on bywinona.com, I noticed the homepage scored slightly lower on Performance, mainly due to large hero images, unused JavaScript, and third-party scripts loading early in the render process. These impact metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI), two of the biggest factors for user experience and SEO.**Improvements:**- **Optimize image delivery:** I notice some large hero images or banners loading without lazy-loading. So a good solution could be to keep existing `<img>` elements where needed, but progressively replace heavier assets with `<NuxtImg>` to leverage Nuxt’s native image optimization and automatic lazy loading.- **Load tracking scripts smartly:** I noticed several third-party scripts (analytics, marketing pixels, tracking tags) loaded in the `<head>`. We can make analytics and pixel scripts load in the background so they don't load early and slow down page rendering.These optimizations directly improve Core Web Vitals, particularly LCP and Total Blocking Time (TBT), leading to better SEO rankings and faster perceived load time for users as speed affects both conversion rates and SEO ranking.We can verify this with Analytics + Core Web Vitals tracking and re-running Lighthouse and comparing metrics before and after deployment.---### Accessibility & semantic structure (second priority)The site can improve how it handles keyboard navigation and landmark elements.**Improvements:**- Ensure descriptive `alt` attributes for all media: some images have `alt` text that aren't descriptive enough and from an accessibility and SEO standpoint, the alt text should briefly describe the content or purpose of the image in context.- Use semantic structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`). Right now the use of some non-semantic HTML (for example `<div>` replacing `<main>` or `<section>`) can reduce clarity for screen-readers.These are common issues on marketing pages and are relatively easy wins.Accessibility improvements often overlap with SEO and usability.  We can verify this with Lighthouse a11y score + screen reader testing.---### Component architecture & developer experience (third priority)The site reuses several design patterns (hero, testimonial, CTA, blog preview). If these aren’t already isolated as **reusable Vue components**, I’d recommend modularizing them to simplify updates and maintain consistency.**Improvements:**- Refactor sections into **modular, prop-driven components**.  - Extract shared logic into `/composables`.  - Introduce **design tokens** (color, typography, spacing) for consistency.This improves maintainability and reduces friction for future development.---## 5. Sharing promo data between the website and patient portalTo make sure both the marketing website and the patient portal display the same $50 off banner or promo, I’d set up a **shared source of truth** for promotions: something both apps can read from, rather than duplicating logic in each codebase.The cleanest way to do this is through a small **Promotions API** (or a collection in the existing backend) that stores data like the promo code, message, start and end dates, and which platforms it should appear on.  Both the website and the portal would fetch this data from that API, which ensures any updates (like changing the discount or disabling the promo) are reflected everywhere instantly.For performance, I’d use **edge caching** or **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** so the website can serve promo data fast without hitting the API on every request.  If marketing needs to manage these promos directly, the API could pull from **Contentful**, with a webhook that triggers rebuilds or cache updates when content changes.For personalization — for example, if someone lands on the website with a `?promo=50OFF` parameter, I’d store that value in a cookie or localStorage. When the user later signs in to the portal, the promo would still apply and show the same banner.This setup keeps data consistent, scalable, and easy to maintain: one source, automatic syncing, and no manual coordination between the two systems.---## 6. Setting up the team for fast but reliable software developmentTo move quickly without breaking things, I’d focus on a clean development workflow, automated deployments, and a branching model that keeps production stable but easy to update.### Infrastructure and environmentsI’d host the marketing site on a Cloud Platform like Vercel (it integrates perfectly with Nuxt and gives automatic preview deployments for every pull request).  This means that marketing, QA, and design can review each change live before it’s merged, no manual testing or waiting on staging builds.For environments:- **Production** → stable, public site- **Staging** → mirrors production for testing new content- **Preview** → auto-created for each PRThis setup enables fast iteration while keeping production safe.---### Branching modelKeep it simple and developer-friendly:- `main` → always production-ready- `feature/*` → individual tasks or improvements- `hotfix/*` → urgent fixes directly from `main`Each PR is automatically tested and built by Vercel, so it’s clear if something breaks before merging.---### Pull request workflow- Small, focused PRs for quick reviews- At least one reviewer is required (ideally another dev or lead)- Automated checks: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and Vitest tests- Preview link generated for visual QAMerging to `main` automatically deploys to production.---### Developer experienceI’d use **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) for clear history and changelogs.  A short onboarding doc would explain setup, environment variables, and deploy flow so new team members can ramp up fast.---### ReliabilityAutomated tests (unit + integration), performance monitoring with Lighthouse CI, and Sentry for error tracking help us catch regressions before users do.Every change is tested, previewed, and reviewed before going live, keeping the release process **fast, consistent, and low-risk**, even as the team scales.
